# hangman-kata
An exercise focused on learning to unit test with infrastructure or non-deterministic dependencies

This project is based on how my current team (late 2019) approached the exercise our first time.
Something different would likely emerge if we did it again or if another team were doing it.    

As we worked through, we preserved the stages of our work in a sequence of branches, described below. 

I tried to recon for the team by starting the next phase of work, and I made branches for that work, too.  
 

# Stages

Here are the stages of work, with the matching branch were that stage was completed:
 
1) Ready to start: Project bootstrapped with some files `master`
2) Getting started: Several pieces of simple logic and tests `dsf`


### Ruby Versions, Use of RubyMine / RVM, etc

* This code was started using Ruby 2.2.10.
* The checked in project files (should) specify a gemset 'hangman'.
